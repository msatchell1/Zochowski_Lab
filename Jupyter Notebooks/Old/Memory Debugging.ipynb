    "Code taken from \"80 LE Network 3\" on 5/3/22\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    " - Figure out what is causing so much of my PC's memory to be consumed when running a simulation and fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes\n",
    "\n",
    " - Changed number of neurons in network, including in init_nrn() how large the non-BB population is. Just to make code run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Deleted the i_current_hist attribute from neuron object. It was not being used in the program, and was occupying unnecessary space.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Solution found:\n",
    " - Notice how when we elimnated the cw_out_history variable (that's the main difference between the old code and me current code) that we lost not only the memory allocation from cw_out_history (as expected) but ALSO the numpy storage amount cut in half! So this massive megabyte storage is in fact a result of cw_out_history and cw_in_history. To fix this, I appended to these arrays only every 10 ms instead of every 1 ms, in the future I may also need to try and make my code dependant on only one of the cw histories, as I am sure it is redundant to have both.\n",

    "Notice how when we elimnated the cw_out_history variable (that's the main difference between this old code and me current code) that we lost not only the memory allocation from cw_out_history (as expected) but ALSO the numpy storage amount cut in half! So this massive megabyte storage is in fact a result of cw_out_history and cw_in_history. To fix this, I first plan to append to these arrays only every 10 ms instead of every ms, but also to try and make my code dependant on only one of the cw histories, as I am sure it is redundant to have both."
