This repo contains code for running all simulations and generating plots for all modeling figures in the publication:

"Neuromodulation via muscarinic acetylcholine pathway can facilitate
distinct, complementary, and sequential roles for NREM and REM
states during sleep-dependent memory consolidation."

The most up to date version of code is available under Jupyter Notebooks / New .

For simulations involving two backbone "memories" in competition and only one iteration of NREM and REM, see "single_cycle_simulation.ipynb" and the subsequent plotting notebook "single_cycle_plot.ipynb". For simulations involving multiple iterations of NREM and REM, see "multiple_cycle_simulation" and "multiple_cycle_plot".
