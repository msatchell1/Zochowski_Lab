    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    " - Change simulation so that only NREM learning is played. Also turn off plasticity. I need to adjust my parameters so that NREM activates simultaneously the green and blue LE neurons. This is the necessary beginning for my simulations, because I need the blue and green LE neurons to be strengthened to their backbones as a result of NREM, but not in an orthogonal way. Michal suggested turning off activity of the pink and purple LE neurons when doing these tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - In order to activate both green and blue LE during NREM, I have the following options: 1. increasing BBtoLE_mult, 2. increasing LEtoLE_mult, 3. decreasing SSTtoLE_mult, 4. decreasing LEtoSST. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Adjusted param so that NREM starts at t=0 and lasts until end of simulation.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Turned off plasticity for entire simulation.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Added param.LEtoSST_mult and param.LEtoBB_mult.\n",
